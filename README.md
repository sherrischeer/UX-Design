# User Experience (UX) Design

UX Design is a process that can be used to design anything from products to bicycles to mobile applications.  The focus of this design process puts the users' needs first--making their interaction with the product a pleasureable one.  

Don Norman of [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/definition-user-experience/) coined the term 'user experience' in the early days at Apple.

>'User Experience' encompasses all aspects of the end-user's interaction with the company, its services, and its products.

### The job of a UX Professional is to investigate the cause of conflict and resolve it.

One way to do this is through a process called **Human-Centered Design:**

## Human-Centered Design
HCD is a framework that follows a hands-on, user-centric approach to problem solving.

**Empathize:**  Learning the patterns of behavior.  Find out what the users do, say, think and feel.

**Define:**  Define the user problem that you will focus on.  This is done by analying all the research from the empathy stage and grouping common pain points for example.

**Ideate:**  Totally free creativity here!  Brainstorm.  Come up with as many ideas as you can.  No idea is too crazy. Try to meet the users needs that were identified in the define phase.

**Prototype:**  Build, get feedback, refine, and repeat.  The goal here is to make sure your solution is on target by creating something simple and quick to present to the users to get feedback.

**Test:**  Return to the original users for feedback if this solution has improved how they feel, think and do their task.  Does it achieve their goals?

### Ultimately, the goal of HCD is to connect the business goals to the user's needs through this process of testing and refinement so that all parties are satisfied.

# User Interface (UI) Design  

UI Design falls under the **Ideate phase** of the design process.  It is a part of the UX design process, but the goal is different.  The UI Designer is responsible for transferring the products research, content and layout into an attractive, guiding, responsive experience for the users.  It is a digital, visual part of the process.

The UI Designers work closely to the UX designers to make sure every step the user will experience in their interaction will conform to the overall vision created by the UX Designers.


## 10 General Principles for User Interface Design

### 1. Visibility of system status 

The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.

The Progress Bar is an example of Visibility.  It gives the user a sense of control and trust.

### 2. Match between system and the real world 

The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.

Airbnb uses simple familiar language and booking form.

### 3. User control and freedom

Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.





Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/sherrischeer/UX_Design/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
